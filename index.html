  <h1>For the Country That Never Loved Him Back</h1>
  <h2>In Memory of Leonard Matlovich</h2>

  <p>They etched his name on a grave without rights,</p>
  <p>"When I was in the military, they gave me a medal for killing two men and a discharge for loving one."</p>
  <p>In silence, he served a nation that feared his truth,</p>
  <p>Wearing boots heavy with the weight of a double life.</p>

  <p>Each salute became a whisper,</p>
  <p>A hope that maybe love and duty could share a uniform.</p>

  <p>But the flag that draped his coffin did not know his name,</p>
  <p>Only the shame it assigned him for who he loved.</p>

  <p>He stood—open, unashamed—</p>
  <p>And was buried by the same country that asked for silence again.</p>

  <p>Today, we unearth him with every truth we dare to speak,</p>
  <p>In TikToks, in protests, in drag shows defiant and divine.</p>

  <p>He walks with us—</p>
  <p>In ballrooms turned battlegrounds,</p>
  <p>In love letters mailed from barracks, unopened, returned.</p>

  <p>This country may never have loved him back,</p>
  <p>But we will. Over and over again,</p>
  <p>With every queer breath, every uncloseted morning,</p>
  <p>We will remember Leonard, not just in mourning—</p>
  <p>But in the living.</p>
